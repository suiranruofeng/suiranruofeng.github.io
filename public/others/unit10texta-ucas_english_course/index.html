<p>医生的困境：伤害永远是好事吗？</p>
<p>First paragraph:<br>
Medical knowledge changes swiftly, and technological changes make new and expensive investigations and treatments possible that were only theoretical a few years ago. Life has been extended in length, but not in quality, and the debates about end‑of‑life decisions show us how much the notion of a &ldquo;good life&rdquo; is bound up with the absence of disease, illness and suffering.</p>
<p>第一段:<br>
医学知识变化迅速,技术变革使得新的昂贵的检查和治疗成为可能,这在几年前还只是理论性的。人类寿命延长了,但生活质量并没有提高,关于生命终点的争论表明,对&quot;美好生活&quot;的理解与是否摆脱疾病、疾患和痛苦密切相关。</p>
<p>Second paragraph:<br>
The practice of medicine is not purely technical. It involves a relationship between a person who is seeking help, and who may be vulnerable, and a person who has the skills and knowledge to help. Relationships that involve disparities of power, knowledge and vulnerability require some degree of external oversight and regulation. Traditionally, in medicine, this oversight has taken the form of codes of ethics, starting with the Hippocratic Corpus. Today, bodies such as the General Medical Council and the Royal Colleges define the standards of good medical practice.</p>
<p>第二段:<br>
医疗实践并非纯粹的技术。它涉及一个寻求帮助的人(可能处于弱势地位)和一个拥有技能和知识的人之间的关系。涉及权力、知识和脆弱性差异的关系需要某种程度的外部监管和规范。在医疗领域,这种监管传统上采取了医疗道德准则的形式,从希波克拉底学说开始。如今,诸如普通医疗委员会和皇家医学会等机构定义了良好医疗实践的标准。</p>
<p>Third paragraph:<br>
There has been much discussion of how we make moral choices, but what do we mean by a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; decision in medicine? Conventionally, we are distinguishing what is clinically and technically possible from whether it is &ldquo;right&rdquo; to intervene at all. For example, if a person&rsquo;s heart stops, we know we can resuscitate them, but should we do so?</p>
<p>第三段:<br>
我们一直在讨论如何做出道德选择,但在医学中什么才是&quot;道德&quot;决策呢?通常情况下,我们区分了临床和技术上的可能性,以及是否&quot;正确&quot;进行干预。例如,如果一个人的心脏停止跳动,我们知道可以对其进行复苏,但我们是否应该这样做?</p>
<p>Fourth paragraph:<br>
To answer that question, we do not expect to rely solely on numerical data and we do not anticipate getting an obvious and single answer. We are aware that there may be more than one answer to the question, and those answers may conflict with each other. We will want to get clinical information about the situation: why did the heart stop? Will restarting the heart make things better or worse for that person in medical terms? We will also want to know what the patient thinks about the situation: did they anticipate this? Do they want to be resuscitated? And if we don&rsquo;t know these things, we will want to ask some questions about how best to make a complex decision if we have not heard the wishes of the person concerned.</p>
<p>Fifth paragraph:
Moral reasoning differs from those types of reasoning that are purely computational, logical or algorithmic. To answer ethical questions, we engage in a process of reflection and discussion: we begin a discourse that uses the words &ldquo;ought&rdquo; and &ldquo;should&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;can&rdquo; and &ldquo;must&rdquo;. If the patient&rsquo;s heart has stopped because they are losing blood, then a doctor may say: &ldquo;We must give the patient more blood or his heart will stop, and we can do so because the blood is here and we know it will work.&rdquo; However, that statement does not answer the question: &ldquo;Should we resuscitate the patient if his heart stops?&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s statement about what can be done is not irrelevant, but it is only a part of the reasoning process involved in deciding whether it is right to resuscitate. If the patient had left instructions that they did not want to be resuscitated if their heart stopped during surgery, then the facts of successful resuscitation practice would be irrelevant to what the doctors should do.</p>
<p>第五段:
道德推理与纯粹的计算、逻辑或算法式的推理不同。要回答伦理问题,我们需要进行反思和讨论:我们开始使用&quot;应该&quot;和&quot;必须&quot;这样的词语,而不是&quot;可以&quot;和&quot;必须&quot;。如果患者心脏停止是因为失血,医生可能会说:&ldquo;我们必须给患者输更多的血,否则他的心脏就会停止,而且我们可以这样做,因为血液就在这里,我们知道这样做会有效。&ldquo;然而,这样的声明并没有回答&quot;我们是否应该对这个病人进行心脏复苏&quot;这个问题。医生关于&quot;可以做什么&quot;的声明并非无关紧要,但它只是在决定是否应该复苏时涉及的推理过程的一部分。如果患者预先表示不希望在手术期间心脏停止时被复苏,那么成功复苏的事实对医生们应该做什么就不再重要了。</p>
<p>Sixth paragraph:
What we are distinguishing here are facts and values – a distinction developed by David Hume in the 18th century. Hume says that it is a fallacy to think that because things are a certain way (facts), then they should be that way (values). We cannot derive values from facts, but we do evaluate facts and make moral judgments about them, and this reasoning and reflection process is crucial to medical ethical decision-making.</p>
<p>第六段:
我们在此区分的是事实和价值观 - 这是18世纪哲学家休谟提出的区分。休谟说,认为事物之所以是某种方式(事实),就应该是那样(价值观)是一种谬论。我们无法从事实中推导出价值观,但我们确实会评估事实并对其做出道德判断,而这种推理和反思过程对于医疗伦理决策至关重要。</p>
<p>Seventh paragraph:
For centuries, it was assumed that a good decision ethically in medicine was the same as a good clinical decision. If the doctor did what was medically indicated to benefit the patient, then this was the ethically right thing to do. Although sometimes crudely summarised as &ldquo;doctor knows best&rdquo;, this approach to ethical dilemmas in medicine is (arguably) less about the doctor&rsquo;s status, and more about the tensions between facts and values.</p>
<p>第七段:
数百年来,人们一直认为在医学中做出的好的道德决定与好的临床决定是相同的。如果医生采取了有利于患者的医疗措施,那么这就是在道德上正确的做法。尽管这种观点有时被简单地概括为&quot;医生最了解&rdquo;,但这种处理医疗伦理困境的方法,更多地是关于事实和价值之间的张力,而不是医生地位的问题。</p>
<p>Eighth paragraph:
Medicine as a science utilises a method of study that focuses on consequences of actions, on causes and effects in nature. These facts about how bodies heal, or how drugs work, are sometimes confused with medicine&rsquo;s ethical imperative to bring about good consequences for the patient, or at least reduce harmful consequences. Concerns tend to arise when there is friction between the facts and values.</p>
<p>第八段:
医学作为一门科学,采用的研究方法侧重于行动的结果,以及自然界中的因果关系。关于身体如何治愈或药物如何发挥作用的这些事实,有时会与医学对给患者带来良好结果,或至少减少有害结果的道德要求混淆。当事实和价值观之间出现摩擦时,通常会引发关切。</p>
<p>Ninth paragraph:
Modern medical ethics developed out of an examination of medical authority after the second world war, partly in response to the Nuremberg trials of doctors who had used medicine to torment and kill citizens, but also in sympathy with a general increase of attention to the human rights of ordinary people which had previously been denied – people of colour, women and those made vulnerable by illness.</p>
<p>第九段:
现代医疗伦理是在二战后审视医疗权威而发展起来的,部分原因是为了回应那些利用医学折磨和杀害公民的医生在纽伦堡审判中受到的指责,但也部分原因是为了关注此前被忽视的普通人(如少数族裔、妇女和病弱者)的人权。</p>
<p>Tenth paragraph:
Legal cases reflected this change: in one famous instance (Murray v McMurchy, in 1949), while operating on a woman for another purpose, a surgeon tied her fallopian tubes without her consent, because he foresaw that becoming pregnant would be clinically dangerous for her, and that it would also be dangerous for her to undergo two surgical procedures. She sued for negligence and won: it was not disputed that the surgeon was factually correct, in clinical terms, but he had not considered that the patient&rsquo;s own view of herself and her body were essential to the decision-making process. He had focused on facts, and assigned no value to the patient&rsquo;s view, even though it was her body that was being operated on.</p>
<p>第十段:
法律案例反映了这一变化:在一个著名的案例(1949年的Murray v McMurchy案)中,一位外科医生在为一位女性进行其他手术时,未经她同意就给她做了输卵管结扎手术,因为他预见到她怀孕会对她的健康造成临床危险,再进行两次手术也会有风险。这位女性提起了疏忽诉讼并获胜:尽管医生在临床方面是正确的,但他没有考虑到患者自己对自己和身体的看法对决策过程至关重要。他只关注事实,而没有重视患者的意愿,尽管手术是在她的身体上进行的。</p>
<p>Eleventh paragraph:
This case brings us to an important issue in moral reasoning generally, which is how we think about words like &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;best&rdquo;, in relation to a human decision. It is not a question of whether we want doctors to make ethical decisions on a daily basis – it is a fact that this will happen in the world of medical practice. What we want is for doctors to make &ldquo;good&rdquo; ethical decisions, or at least the &ldquo;best possible&rdquo;. We want to know that they have engaged in the type of thinking that takes account of values and personal lived experience.</p>
<p>第十一段:
这个案例让我们关注到道德推理中一个重要的问题,即我们如何看待&quot;好&rdquo;、&ldquo;正确&quot;或&quot;最佳&quot;这样的词语,与人类决策之间的关系。问题不在于我们是否希望医生们日常做出伦理决定 - 这在医疗实践中是事实。我们要求的是,医生们做出&quot;好&quot;的伦理决定,或者至少是最佳的决定。我们希望知道他们已经进行了考虑价值观和个人经验的思考过程。</p>
<p>Twelfth paragraph:
The doctor is empowered to do harm to the patient in pursuit of doing good, and there is a social acceptance that treatment may entail a deliberately imposed suffering that is not the primary intention of the doctor. This acceptance requires a great deal of trust in the medical profession – and doctors are still the most trusted professional group. The trust that makes these interactions possible assumes that doctors will not be the kind of people who exploit vulnerability and exercise influence for their own ends. There is a question here about how society expects doctors not just to be good technically, but to be good personally.</p>
<p>第十二段:
医生被赋予了为了行善而伤害患者的权力,社会也接受医疗可能会带来并非医生本意的蓄意痛苦。这种接受需要对医疗专业有极大的信任 - 而医生仍然是最受信任的专业群体。这种使互动成为可能的信任,假设医生不会是那种利用脆弱性并为自己的目的而施加影响力的人。这里存在一个问题,即社会不仅希望医生在技术上出色,还希望他们在个人品德上也出色。</p>
<p>Thirteenth paragraph:
There are other accounts of ethical reasoning that may be helpful when thinking about doctors as good people. In his book, Justice: What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?, Michael Sandel has argued that moral decision-makers need to follow an ethical reasoning process that pays attention to justice and the ways that people weigh the value of their decisions. He argues that impartiality is not always the keystone of justice, but rather that justice processes need to pay attention to what people value.</p>
<p>第十三段:
在思考医生作为善良人的问题时,还有其他有助于道德推理的观点。在他的著作《正义:做正确的事情》中,迈克尔·桑德尔论述了道德决策者需要遵循关注正义和人们如何权衡决策价值的道德推理过程。他认为公正性并非正义的关键,而是正义进程需要关注人们所重视的东西。</p>
<p>Fourteenth paragraph:
There remains a question about whether it is just and fair to expect a group of people who are chosen for cognitive intelligence and skills in exam-passing to become morally superior individuals. It is often said that doctors are held to a higher moral standard than other people, but how are they trained to that higher moral standard? After the Harold Shipman inquiry, it was recommended that doctors undergo revalidation every five years, but there is no evidence that the revalidation process addresses moral reasoning or the moral identity of doctors. Doctors still do &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things, even when they are good people in other ways, and technically good at what they do.</p>
<p>第十四段:
仍然存在一个问题,即是否公平合理地期望那些因认知智力和考试技能而被选中的人群成为道德上更优秀的个体。通常人们认为医生应该被要求达到比其他人更高的道德标准,但他们是如何被培养达到这种更高的道德标准的呢?在哈罗德·希普曼调查之后,建议医生每五年重新认证一次,但没有证据表明这个认证过程关注了医生的道德推理或道德认同。即便在其他方面是善良的人,在技术上擅长工作的医生,仍然会做一些&quot;不好&quot;的事情。</p>
<p>Fifteenth paragraph:
Medicine needs a way of thinking about ethics that addresses different moral values and intuitions. What remains unclear is how we train doctors to be good people, not just to do good work and make good choices.</p>
<p>第十五段:
医学需要一种能够解决不同道德价值观和直觉的伦理思维方式。目前仍不清楚我们如何培养医生成为善良的人,而不仅仅是做好工作和做出正确的选择。</p>
